# HomeProject
My home project repository.

I use this repository to share python notebooks, csvs, text files and everything else I create during self-studying.

Working on my data science skills at home. Trying to improve on programming, data analysis and visualization with this project. I'm using Git to connect my repository on GitHub to my PC.
