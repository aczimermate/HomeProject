# HomeProject
My home project repository.

I'm going to use this repository to share python notebooks, csvs, text files and everything else I created at home.

Working on my Python skills at home. Trying to improve on programming, data analysis and visualization with this project. I'm using Git to connect my repository on GitHub to my laptop.
